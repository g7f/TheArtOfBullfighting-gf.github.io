    <h2>Bullfighting is a sacrigicial ritual un which men (and also a few women) pit themselves against an animal bred
      for the ring. In this "authentic religious drama", as poet Garica Lorca describe it, the spectator exercise
      vicariously the fear and felt by the matador. Althrough some Spaniards oppose it on grounds of its cruelty, it is
      as popular as ever. Many Spaniards see talk banning bullfighting as striking at the essence of their being, for
      they regard the <i>toreo</i>, the art of bulllfgiting, as a noble part of their heritage. Bullfighting today,
      however, are often debase by practices which weaken the bull, eapecially shaving its horns to make them blunt.
